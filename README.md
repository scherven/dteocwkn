it's a deckbuilder...it's a townbuilder....no, it's superman!

# Task List

- [x] make the hand generate above the world
- [x] make the tiles generate closer together
- [ ] add hovering a given tile
  - [x] highlights around the tile
  - [ ] after 1 second: that brings up property box
  - [ ] (later) property box stays if you hover over it?
  - [ ] (later) clicking tile centers & brings up things that are on it?
- [ ] put things on the different cards
- [ ] when you mouse over them they go from tucked together to spread out so you can read them
- [ ] when you hover one while it's spread out it zooms in a bit or you can click to have a full inspect go on



## Ideas

- [ ] Game generates grid of tiles - each is highlightable and has properties (?)
- [ ] Hand of cards - cards have their resources above them for ease of understanding
- [ ] when you mouse over them they go from tucked together to spread out so you can read them
- [ ] when you hover one while it's spread out it zooms in a bit or you can click to have a full inspect go on
- [ ] you can toggle on a setting for resource cards to play automatically, this is animated at the start of your turn
- [ ] top right - resources, bottom right - end turn button, top left - market(?)
- [ ] unclear how market works at the moment

## First MVP

- [ ] grid of tiles - highlightable w/ mouse & camera controllable - circle of green in the ocean (so you can get a feel for camera controls)
- [ ] highlighting a tile brings up its type
- [ ] player starts with 10 wood cards
- [ ] cards in the bottom - tucked together
- [ ] move mouse down - spread out
- [ ] click card - brings up inspect screen

## Second MVP

- [ ] resources cards play themselves automatically => go to resources in upper right
  - [ ] cool animation?
- [ ] ending the turn resets the resources
- [ ] market - things to buy in upper left
- [ ] can buy:
  - [ ] storehouse - allows you to hold x number of resources
    - [ ] also - goes into your deck; when drawn, it pulls the next two resource cards out of your deck and puts them in your hand
  - [ ] house - gives you room for people; people do what?
    - [ ] also - goes into your deck (every building goes into your deck, at least for now) - and does something? maybe the people get happier? or it increases the specialization level of each person in the house by one? (if they have a job)
    - [ ] ok so yeah - people have jobs (assignment screen? on the left?)

## Third MVP

- [ ] so far we only have storehouse & house
- [ ] add more buildings?
- [ ] researcher - upgrades acrds
- [ ] blacksmith - enables you to add iron cards to your deck, stone cards, etc
- [ ] gold cards make money?
- [ ] food cards???
- [ ] ...

## Fourth MVP

- [ ] some way to end the game
- [ ] we want the star realms experience where you're sweating drawing good hands by the end
- [ ] the end? what is the end
- [ ] let's focus on getting to the second MVP and then sketching out the rest
